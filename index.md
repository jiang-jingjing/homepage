 Jingjing Jiang, Dr. Sc. ETH
------------
I am a junior research group leader at Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory (BORL), University Hospital and University of Zurich. I obtained Doctor of Science degree from ETH Zurich in February 2021, with the thesis entitled [Imaging with near infrared light](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/468947).  My research interests focus on non-invasive optical imaging, medical imaging, image reconstruction, and machine learning.
