## Pioneer imaging system &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <img src="/assets/images/logo_pioneer.png" width="30%" height="30%">

<strong>
<span style="font-family:Lato; font-size:20px; color:#29A0B1;">   Pioneer provides high-precision 3D images of brain oxygenation. This valuable information helps early diagnosis of preterm brain lesions.   </span> <strong>

I received the UZH [Entrepreneur Fellowship](https://innovation.uzh.ch/en/stories/fellows/Jiang-Jingjing.html) for this project and joined the UZH IncubatorLab in December 2021. 

The ultimate goal is to bring Pioneer to the market first for brain imaging in preterm infants and to expand it to many other clinical fields (e.g., anesthesia, oncology, angiology, intensive care medicine).
