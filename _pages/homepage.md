## Jingjing Jiang, Dr. Sc. ETH
 
<span style="font-family:Lato; font-size:20px;">
I am a junior research group leader affiliated with [Prof. Dr. sc. tech. Martin Wolf](https://www.usz.ch/team/martin-wolf/)'s Research Laboratory  at University Hospital. I obtained Doctor of Science degree from ETH Zurich in February 2021, with the thesis entitled [Imaging with near infrared light](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/468947).  My research interests focus on non-invasive optical imaging, medical imaging, image reconstruction, and machine learning.
