## Jingjing Jiang, Dr. Sc. ETH
 
<span style="font-family:Lato; font-size:20px;">
I am a research group leader of the Computational Optical Imaging Research Groupï¼Œ affiliated with [Prof. Dr. sc. tech. Martin Wolf](https://www.usz.ch/team/martin-wolf/)'s Research Laboratory  at University Hospital and University of Zurich. My professional goal is to lead the innovation to address  unmet medical needs  and contribute to a better world. To fulfill that, I pursued a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering and specialized in medical imaging after my undergraduate study in Electronics and Information Engineering. After that, I focused on non-invasive near infrared optical imaging and obtained Doctor of Science degree from ETH Zurich in February 2021, with the thesis entitled [Imaging with near infrared light](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/468947).  My research interests are optical imaging, medical imaging, image reconstruction, image analysis and machine learning.
